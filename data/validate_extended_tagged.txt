When I lived in *Paris last year, *France was experiencing a recession. The night life was too fun, I developed an addiction to !Adderall and !cocaine. I took a train down to *Barcelona, and brought my friends. They brought me a truckload of !Xanax. We spent a week there, and then left for *Dublin, where we picked up several bricks of black tar !heroin. Following this, we boarded a plane to the *US where we road tripped across *America starting in *Maryland. We picked up a caseload of tabs of !LSD from a hippie, and made our way to *St. *Louis. In *St. *Louis, we raided a hospital for 16 jars of !Percoset pills.
