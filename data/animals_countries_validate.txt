Philip Glass has been hunting wild !animals since before he can even remember It started with !rabbits and !squirrels progressing to !deer when he was 10 and now that he’s 46 he cannot begin to count how many !animals he’s killed let alone how many varieties “I’m a rancher in *Texas and !predator hunting is part of my life” he explains “I shoot !coyotes and !deer to keep my !sheep alive But I’m also a trophy hunter I’ve shot four out of the big five in Africa a !lion a !leopard a !buffalo and an !elephant The only one I havent shot is a !rhino” His journey to killing a !lion and !elephant is documented in the BBC Four documentary Trophy The Big Game Hunting Controversy It is difficult viewing for !animal lovers Glass is seen shooting an !elephant that lies on the ground moaning in pain and distress before it finally dies And a strong male !lion is shot in its natural habitat And Glass discusses the 20 trophies he has on his walls at home – the “coolest” of which he says is a !giraffe “For most hunters an !animal head on the wall is a memory of a very special time in their lives” he says “It’s not just a dusty trophy – it’s a reverence When I see my trophies I remember the rush and thrill of each of those hunts I thank God for those !animals and those trips where I got to travel the world and see them in their natural habitats” Philip GlassBBC THREEPHILIP GLASS Philip Glass Nowadays trophy hunting is often seen as brutally cruel and unnecessary When Cecil the !Lion was shot in 2015 there was widespread outrage The !lion was a known favourite at a national park but was killed when he was outside the parks boundaries – which is legal It was insinuated that he was lured off the park but Zimbabwe dropped all charges against the hunter in question It led to petitions where thousands called for justice for Cecil Glass says he accepts the viewpoint that killing !wildanimals for pleasure is upsetting and gratuitous But he defends himself by pointing out that what he does is legal He says trophy hunters are nothing like poachers who illegally kill endangered !animals to sell on their parts – such as ivory or !rhino horns and that licensed hunters pay a large fee to governmentapproved organisations that can go up to six figures “I’m completely antipoaching” says Glass “It’s against the law and there’s no death more painful and long than an animal being hung in a poacher’s snare I see myself as a conservationist” The idea that hunting can lead to conservation comes down to the fact that in some *African countries such as *Zambia and *Zimbabwe half of the money from a hunt is meant to go to the community and conservation groups However critics say that in *Zimbabwe less than 05 of the *countrys GDP comes from trophy hunting itself and that the benefits often fail to reach ordinary *Zimbabweans Meanwhile a 2009 report from the International Union for Conservation of Nature revealed that sport hunting in *West *Africa does not provide significant benefits to the surrounding communities Zoologist Craig Packer – who also features in the BBC Four documentary disagrees with Glass’s justification for hunting “To Glass God put all the !lions on *Earth so it’s fine to shoot them What he implies is there’s an inexhaustible supply of nature but that’s really far from reality There are only between 2030000 wild !lions left in *North *Africa There aren’t as many !lions left to shoot anymore” Philip Glass in actionBBC THREEPHILIP GLASS Philip Glass in action He also points out that half of a hunting fee – typically between 25000 and 50000 – isn’t enough to protect !animals from poachers and local communities “The difficulty in conserving an animal like the !lion thats so fierce and dangerous is that it’s very expensive says Packer Yes hunters pay money to go and they may well in their heart believe that money is enough to make a difference But it’s not If they gave 1 million per hunt and 100 of it went to conservation then that would be closer to the amount that’s needed” Of course the other major criticism of trophy hunting comes from !animal rights groups PETA says on its website “Hunting is now nothing more than a violent form of recreation that the vast majority of hunters do not need for subsistence Hunting has contributed to the extinction of !animal species all over the world including the *Tasmanian !tiger and the great !auk” The !animal rights organisation also highlights the pain it can inflict on !animals if they are hurt and not killed as well as the negative effect on natural habitats and ecosystems Philip Glass says that he tries very hard to be ethical with killing and to do his “due diligence” He explains “People think I jump on an airplane get off run out to the bush and shoot a !lion but that’s not even close to the real process I plan a year in advance If I want to hunt a !buffalo I want to know if the management of the hunt I book has a good success rate that they’re open about their permits and that they’re straightup and honest I read books on anatomy so I know how to shoot an !animal ethically causing it minimum pain and I go to a shooting school for dangerous game hunting” However his efforts do not always pay off In the documentary the !elephant he shoots looks like it is in pain and appears to be shrieking Glass is uncomfortable about this and says he thinks it looks exaggerated on film but accepts “It is hard for people to watch It’s upsetting to me just the same as it is to you” Philip and one of his trophiesBBC THREEPHILIP GLASS Philip and one of his trophies His views on !animals seem conflicted He calls himself an !animal lover but also believes in killing them for sport “I live with !animals I feed them care for them and hunt them too because I love them” he says “But though I love !animals I don’t believe they have any rights I think that’s a modern myth that’s been created by people At the very beginning of the Bible when God mentions mankind he gives men dominion over all !animals We’re in charge But we’re also responsible I take that seriously and try to be ethical when I shoot” There is a moment caught on film when he shoots his first !lion and cries “I can’t apologise for that rush of emotion” he says “It was a mixture of pride and joy at achieving a dream I never felt I could have The !lion is something I never thought I could hunt It was the most gorgeous !lion – a single solitary male I don’t feel guilty about shooting him because Im certain that if I hadn’t he would have died being torn limbtolimb by other !lions” Glass says he is aware that many viewers of the documentary will not understand his views – that they will see him as cruel and delusional He says he has already received huge amounts of abuse online particularly on social media where he proudly poses with the animals he has shot – a !leopardan !elephant a !baboon – but he doesn’t care “Most people won’t ever understand the heart of a true hunter” says Glass “Critics don’t have to like it but I believe that what we do helps !wildlife I appreciate their heart for !animals but I want them to know I have the same heart I just do things in a different way”
